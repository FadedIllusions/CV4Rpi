This repo houses an exhibition of the skills I acquired via Adrian Rosebrock's case studies for his book entitled "Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision".

Adrian can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ .

His book, "Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision" can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/raspberry-pi-for-computer-vision/ .

I highly recommend any and all of Adrian's books for those new in the field or wanting to delve deeper and have a better understanding of the concepts.
